Respository for the assignment Kiowa, Rebecca, Michelle
* test, Rebecca can edit*

TO make it easier for us all we should have all variables as clear as possible, im going to edit the code so that everything should make more sense! also i forgot to comment some of the things i added so i will comment as much as possible!
apologies if the things dont makes sense that i write!

Create a pull request instead of eiditing the files shown this way we dont accidentally delete stuf (when we pull the requested coe it merges with the original file so we can all upload at the saem time without having to wait for he main files to be updated...Thanks - Kiowa
