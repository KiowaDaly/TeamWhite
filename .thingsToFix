Error Messages:
When it is someone's go, don't let them type "done" until they take their turn
When it's someone's go don't let them type "roll" again
Make sure they insert a name. Only let them insert a string with letters. Put a minimum of 2 letters for a name

Things to Fix:
Needs to close inputDialog when user wants it to close at the starting screen, insead of other boxes popping up
Put token and name together when prompting user for their turn, rather than just the name
When click enter the dagger weapon keeps going right. Fix for Sprint 3
